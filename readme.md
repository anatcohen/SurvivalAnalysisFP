## Project Overview

This project implements a multimodal deep learning approach for survival analysis in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients using CT scans and clinical data.  
The goal is to predict patient survival outcomes based on imaging and metadata, leveraging the DeepMMSA model architecture.
